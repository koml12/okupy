Done:
- Make a timer thread to count down seconds in the background.
- Make abstract base class for application
- Implement abstract class in HackerNews application
- Find the currently installed applications in the main okupy
- Execute the applications in another thread.

To-do:
- Terminate the execution thread when the timer runs out.
  Ideally, able to call the stop() method on the application when the timer 
  is up, so we aren't left with unclosed data at the end.
