Done:
- Make a timer thread to count down seconds in the background.
- Make abstract base class for application
- Implement abstract class in HackerNews application
- Find the currently installed applications in the main okupy
- Execute the applications in another thread.
- Switch to function-based processes instead of threads, and use a Pool to
  connect everything together.

To-do:
- Send a signal to the running app process when the sleep process is up.
  The signal should call the stop() method if possible.
