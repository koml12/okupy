Done:
- Make a timer thread to count down seconds in the background.
- Make abstract base class for application
- Implement abstract class in HackerNews application
- Find the currently installed applications in the main okupy
- Execute the applications in another thread.
- Switch to function-based processes instead of threads, and use a Pool to
  connect everything together.
- Used a simple queue for interprocess communication between the running apps 
  and timer processes. Changed the behavior of the entire program to finish the
  current application if time is up, instead of interrupting the entire program
  and killing everything.
